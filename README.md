# C++ Modules at 42

The C++ modules at 42 are designed to introduce students to object-oriented programming and the advanced features of C++. These modules progressively build upon each other, covering a wide range of C++ concepts and practices.

## Overview of C++ Modules

### CPP Module 00: Basics of C++
- Introduction to C++ syntax
- Namespaces
- Classes, member functions, stdio streams
- Initialization lists, static, const, and other basic concepts

### CPP Module 01: Memory Allocation, References, Pointers to Members
- New and delete operators
- References vs pointers
- File streams
- Pointers to members

### CPP Module 02: Ad-hoc Polymorphism, Operator Overloading
- Orthodox Canonical Class Form
- Operator overloading
- Fixed-point numbers

### CPP Module 03: Inheritance
- Inheritance in C++
- Virtual functions
- Multiple inheritance

### CPP Module 04: Subtype Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, Interfaces
- Abstract classes
- Interfaces
- Deep dive into polymorphism

### CPP Module 05: Try/Catch and Exceptions
- Exception handling in C++
- Creating custom exceptions

### CPP Module 06: C++ Casts
- Different types of casts in C++
- Static_cast, dynamic_cast, reinterpret_cast, const_cast

### CPP Module 07: C++ Templates
- Function templates
- Class templates
- Template specialization

### CPP Module 08: Templated Containers, Iterators, Algorithms
- STL containers
- Iterators
- Standard algorithms

### CPP Module 09: STL
- More advanced use of STL
- Containers adaptors (stack, queue, priority_queue)

## Key Learning Objectives

Throughout these modules, students will:

1. Master the syntax and features specific to C++
2. Understand and apply object-oriented programming principles
3. Learn about memory management in C++
4. Gain proficiency in using the Standard Template Library (STL)
5. Develop skills in writing efficient and reusable C++ code
6. Understand advanced concepts like polymorphism, templates, and exceptions

## Project Approach

Each module typically includes:
- Theoretical concepts introduction
- Practical exercises to apply the learned concepts
- A mini-project to consolidate knowledge
